                    <p>
                        Stream processing systems are at the heart of real-time data handling. They’re used for things like fraud detection, IoT data analysis, and video streaming. However, building and testing these systems can be a nightmare. Developers face:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expensive test environments.</li>
                        <li>Steep learning curves in distributed systems, networking, and data engineering.</li>
                        <li>Endless hours debugging complex pipelines.</li>
                        <li>These challenges slow down innovation and make it hard for smaller teams to compete.</li>
