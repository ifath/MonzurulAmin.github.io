                    <h2>The Challenge: AI's Energy Hunger</h2>
                    <p>
                        LLMs demand massive computational power to function, which translates into significant energy consumption. When these models are integrated into SPAs—systems that process data in real-time—the energy usage soars. Traditional optimization methods fall short because of the distributed and complex nature of SPAs. That's where GreenStream comes in.

                    <h2>What is GreenStream?</h2>
                    <p>
                        GreenStream is a smart framework that tweaks LLM setups for better energy efficiency while keeping their performance intact. It's like turning your AI into a hybrid car: just as powerful but way more eco-friendly. Here's how it works:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Optimized Power Usage:</strong> GreenStream identifies the best power settings for GPUs, the main energy guzzlers during LLM inference.</li>
                        <li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> It adjusts batch sizes to ensure GPUs operate at peak efficiency without overloading memory.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adaptive Inference:</strong> The system adapts parameters like parallelism and I/O length to balance energy savings and performance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="blog-post-section">
                    <h2>Real Results, Real Savings</h2>
                    <p>Initial tests with Meta's Llama 3.1 model showed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A 3x reduction in energy consumption just by increasing batch sizes.</li>
                        <li>Peak efficiency achieved when GPU cores were fully utilized.</li>
                        <li>Smart power capping saved energy without sacrificing output quality.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="blog-post-section">
                    <h2>Why GreenStream Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sustainability in tech isn't just a buzzword anymore; it's a necessity. With AI becoming a core part of industries from healthcare to travel, energy efficiency isn't optional. GreenStream helps reduce carbon footprints while ensuring these systems remain high-performing.

                    <h2>Where Can You Use It?</h2>
                    <p>
                        From fraud detection to real-time translation, any SPA using LLMs can benefit. Imagine a GenAI-powered travel assistant that not only plans your trip but does so without guzzling energy.

                    <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
                    <p>
                        GreenStream is a step toward greener AI. It's proof that we don't have to choose between cutting-edge technology and a sustainable future. By making smarter choices in how we use energy, we can create a world where AI helps us without harming the planet.
